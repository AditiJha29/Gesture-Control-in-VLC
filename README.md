This project focuses on developing a gesture-controlled interface for laptops and computers, enabling users to interact with their devices through simple hand movements. 
Using Arduino-based sensors, the system detects gestures and processes them via Python to execute various computer functions. This gesture control approach offers an intuitive, 
contactless alternative to traditional input devices, enhancing user interaction and accessibility, particularly for individuals with mobility challenges. 
The project explores the potential of integrating hardware and software to create a seamless, real-time, hands-free user experience. Through this development, the project aims 
to demonstrate how gesture control can make human-computer interaction more efficient, accessible, and innovative.

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a gesture-based control system for laptops and computers using Arduino and Python. By integrating hardware and 
software components, the system aims to provide users with an intuitive and contactless interface, allowing them to interact with their devices through hand gestures.
